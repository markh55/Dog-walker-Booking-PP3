## Deployment

### GitHub

Repository
I made a public local repository on my Github account, I then linked my repository to my VSCode account and started building. When writing my code I ensured that I committed my changes to the repository using clear and direct messages for any changes,this is done by doing the following in the terminal;

git add .
git commit -m “Enter message here”
git push
I would send a commit after each change then I would push the file once i made 3 or 4 changes.

Hosting
This is how I hosted my website: On Github I Selected my Dog-Walker-Booking-PP3 Repository, then go to;

Settings
Pages
Once on the pages site I would ensure the following settings were applied; Source would need to be set to ‘Deploy from branch’ Branch will need to be set to main and then root. Save.
